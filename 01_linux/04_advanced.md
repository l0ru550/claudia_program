# Advanced Terminal Exercises

Use the following text file to answer the questions

```bash
Elie-Schoppik-sushi
Tim-Garcia-gummybears
Janey-Keig-bagels
Colt-Steele-tacos
Matt-Lane-pizza
```

1. Replace all of the `-` with `:` using `sed`
2. Return a file with just the first name and last name separated by a space (you can do this with `cut` and `sed` or just `sed`)

```bash
1>>>>2
2>>>>3
3>>>>4
4>>>>5
```

1. Using `cut` print out just the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5. Use `xargs` to print them all on 1 line

1. Using `xargs` in the `Desktop` directory, find all of the files that include the text Welcome`
2. Write a shell script called `access_file.sh` which accepts one parameter and changes the permissions to `755`
3. Write a shell script called `unaccessible.sh` which accepts one parameter and changes the permissions to `300`
4. Using `sed` write the command to replace all instances of the name "foo" with the string "bar" in a file called `baz.txt`
5. Write the command to only print out all of the `pid`s using `awk`
6. Type in the `df -h` command - it will show you much space you have on your hard drive. Using the `awk` command, print out **only** the first percentage capacity.
